This is not an example of condor-dispatch usage; instead, it is an example
of how one might do a parameter sweep in the HTCondor bindings without
condor-dispatch.

Create the directory 'sweep' here before running this example.

You will need to set PYTHONPATH to include the HTCondor Python bindings.
